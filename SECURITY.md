# Security Policy

If you believe youâ€™ve found a security vulnerability, please email
security@lucyintheloop.org with details and a proof of concept. Optionally use
our PGP key published in `SECURITY.txt`.

Coordinated Disclosure: We request 90 days to investigate, patch, and release
before public disclosure. We will acknowledge reporters in release notes unless
you request otherwise.

Safe Harbor: We will not pursue legal action for good-faith, non-destructive
research that respects privacy, does not exploit data, and complies with
applicable laws and this policy.

Additional security and data protection details are in
`docs/security-and-data-protection-policy.md`.

## Health Breach Notification (HBNR) Readiness (U.S.)

If any incident results in unauthorized acquisition of identifiable health
information from users (including wellness data handled by Lucy outside HIPAA),
we will assess applicability of the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule (HBNR).

If HBNR applies, our target process is:

- Investigate and contain incident; preserve forensic evidence.
- Determine scope of affected individuals, data elements, and likelihood of harm.
- Provide individual notices without unreasonable delay and within required
  timelines; notify the FTC and, where applicable, media outlets per HBNR.
- Coordinate with counsel on state health-privacy laws (e.g., WA MHMDA, CA CPRA/CMIA)
  which may impose additional or shorter timelines.
- Document decision-making, timelines, and notices; update this policy and
  technical controls to prevent recurrence.

Report suspected breaches privately to security@lucyintheloop.org.
