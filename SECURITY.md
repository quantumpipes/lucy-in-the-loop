# Security Policy

If you believe youâ€™ve found a security vulnerability, please email
security@lucyintheloop.org with details and a proof of concept. Optionally use
our PGP key published in `SECURITY.txt`.

Coordinated Disclosure: We request 90 days to investigate, patch, and release
before public disclosure. We will acknowledge reporters in release notes unless
you request otherwise.

Safe Harbor: We will not pursue legal action for good-faith, non-destructive
research that respects privacy, does not exploit data, and complies with
applicable laws and this policy.

Additional security and data protection details are in
`docs/security-and-data-protection-policy.md`.
