# Export & Sanctions Notice

Lucy in the Loop may include encryption. You are responsible for compliance
with applicable export, re-export, and sanctions laws, including U.S. EAR and
OFAC regulations and EU/UK measures. Do not download or use if you are a
prohibited party or in a sanctioned destination. Publicly-available open source
code may be subject to exceptions, but your specific use remains your
responsibility.


## Plain-English Overview (U.S. EAR Cat 5, Part 2 and OFAC)

Encryption (EAR Category 5, Part 2). Software that includes or uses encryption
is generally controlled under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
Most open-source encryption is eligible for License Exception **ENC** or is
“mass market,” which typically allows export without a license to most
destinations, but restrictions still apply for embargoed countries and
prohibited end users.

What this means for you:

- You should not export, re-export, or make available the software to
  embargoed jurisdictions (e.g., Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Crimea/
  Donetsk/Luhansk regions) or to denied/restricted parties.
- If you package binaries with encryption, you may need to rely on License
  Exception ENC or mass-market classification. When in doubt, consult counsel
  or BIS guidance.

OFAC Sanctions. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
administers economic and trade sanctions. You must not provide services or
software to persons or entities on OFAC sanctions lists, or to comprehensively
sanctioned territories, without authorization.

Project stance:

- We do not knowingly accept contributions or provide services to sanctioned or
  denied parties.
- We may block participation from embargoed jurisdictions in community systems
  where feasible.
