1) No Professional Advice; No Emergency Use
   • Lucy provides general wellness and educational information only. It is not medical, psychological, legal, or financial advice.

2) Use at Your Own Risk; No Duty to Monitor
   • Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. Review before acting. No clinician‑patient relationship is formed.
   • Lucy may implement safety interlocks and show crisis resources when high‑risk intent is detected. You consent to these interventions.

3) High‑Risk Uses Prohibited
   • Do not use Lucy for clinical diagnosis or treatment, life support, emergency dispatch, aviation, nuclear, or other safety‑critical contexts.

   • Intended for adults (18+). Ages 13–17 only with verified parental consent and professional oversight. Not for children under 13.
