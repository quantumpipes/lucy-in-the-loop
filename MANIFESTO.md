## The Lucy in the Loop Manifesto

We believe mental well‑being is a human right. We believe privacy is a prerequisite for dignity. We believe intelligence should be a public good. And we believe software can do more than run — it can heal, learn, and evolve in service of human flourishing.

Lucy in the Loop is our audacious commitment to these beliefs: a privacy‑first, fully local, self‑evolving companion for mental health and performance — built in the open, governed with radical transparency, and aligned to human values from first principles.

### Why we exist

- **A silent crisis**: Billions live with stress, anxiety, trauma, burnout, and loneliness. Access to care is scarce, expensive, and uneven.
- **A broken bargain**: The modern web often trades well‑being for engagement and privacy for convenience.
- **A different path**: We choose local‑first AI that works for you, answers to you, and lives with you — not above you and never behind your back.

### Our moonshot

- **Universal access, zero extraction**: World‑class, evidence‑informed support that runs entirely on your device. No cloud dependence by default. Your data is your sovereignty.
- **99/1 autonomy with accountability**: Approximately 99% autonomous operation with 1% human oversight for ethics, safety, and policy. Every significant action is explainable, logged, reversible, and under your control.
- **Self‑improving care**: A society of specialized agents that learn, test, and safely improve themselves over time — with kill‑switches, audit trails, and consensus safeguards by design.
- **Open source for collective benefit**: An open ecosystem where clinicians, researchers, engineers, and citizens co‑create a compassionate intelligence for all.

### First principles

- **Autonomy**: You choose. Consent is explicit. Overrides are instant. The user is always the highest authority.
- **Non‑maleficence**: Do no harm. When uncertain, pause, verify, and escalate. Safety outranks novelty.
- **Justice**: Built for everyone. We test for bias, measure equity, and fix regressions as critical bugs.
- **Transparency**: No dark corners. Explanations on request. Immutable, user‑owned logs by default.
- **Privacy**: Local‑first, data‑minimizing, encrypted at rest. No unapproved data egress. Ever.
- **Compassion**: Evidence‑based skills delivered with humility, warmth, and unconditional positive regard.
- **Accountability**: Every agent, every update, every decision — traceable, reversible, and reviewable.
- **Community**: Open code, open governance, open critique. We welcome scrutiny and we improve in public.

### Architecture as ethics

Lucy is a modular “society of agents” collaborating under an orchestrator with explicit guardrails:

- **Safety Stack**: Dedicated risk detection, filtering, and escalation pathways that prioritize user welfare.
- **Explainability by default**: Rationale capture and “Why did you do that?” interfaces for meaningful oversight. See the Transparent Autonomy Policy.
- **Kill‑switches and rollbacks**: One action to halt; one action to revert. Safety is an affordance, not an afterthought.
- **Least‑privilege everything**: Sandboxed agents, zero‑trust data access, signed updates, and verified provenance.
- **Local adaptation**: On‑device personalization to what helps you — not what grows someone else’s metrics.

Refer to these living documents for specifics: [Ethics & Compliance Manifesto](./docs/ethics-compliance-manifesto.md), [Transparent Autonomy Policy](./docs/transparent-autonomy-policy.md), [Security & Data Protection Policy](./docs/security-and-data-protection-policy.md), and [Failsafe & Kill Switch Protocols](./docs/failsafe-and-kill-switch-protocols.md).

### Our commitments

- **To individuals**: We will respect your time, your attention, and your boundaries. We’ll be useful, honest about limits, and quiet when you ask.
- **To clinicians**: We are an adjunct for skill practice and continuity — never a substitute for care. We design for auditability and handoffs.
- **To developers**: We will keep the stack clear, composable, testable, and forkable. We will favor local performance, integrity, and readability over hype.
- **To researchers**: We will translate evidence into accessible protocols. We will invite replication and publish negative results where relevant.
- **To society**: We will not build extractive systems. No dark patterns. No surveillance business models. No engagement traps.

### What we will measure

- **Safety**: Adverse event rate, crisis response conformance, and time‑to‑halt. Target: zero unmitigated harms.
- **Equity**: Outcome parity across demographics; fairness tests baked into CI.
- **Privacy**: Data egress incidents (target: zero). Encryption coverage and key hygiene.
- **Efficacy**: Symptom reduction and well‑being gains in opt‑in evaluations; transparent methodology.
- **Autonomy with oversight**: Auditability, reversibility, and human‑in‑the‑loop adherence for critical actions.

### Our line in the sand

- We will not trade user data for features.
- We will not ship ambiguous safety controls.
- We will not obscure limitations or inflate claims.
- We will not prioritize engagement over well‑being.

### The path ahead

Phase by phase, we will move from a capable, private companion to a continuously improving ecosystem — always guarded by transparency, consent, and control. We aspire to a world where anyone, anywhere, can access effective, culturally sensitive mental health skills without giving up privacy or agency. If we succeed, “software that cares” becomes infrastructure for human thriving.

### A call to builders and guardians

If you are an engineer, clinician, designer, researcher, or simply someone who believes technology should protect what makes us human — help us. Review code. Propose safeguards. Add skills. Write tests. Translate protocols. Audit bias. Improve docs. File ethical concerns. This is a commons of care; your hands shape it.

Contribute via `CONTRIBUTING.md` and our issue templates. Read the [Roadmap](./docs/roadmap.md). Hold us to account.

### Pledge and boundaries

This manifesto is a pledge of intent, not a guarantee of outcome. Lucy in the Loop is wellness software, not a clinician, not a diagnostic device, and not an emergency service. Use is voluntary and at your own risk. For medical concerns, seek licensed professionals. In emergencies, contact local emergency services immediately. See: [DISCLAIMER](./DISCLAIMER.md), [MEDICAL DISCLAIMER](./MEDICAL-DISCLAIMER.md), [TERMS](./TERMS.md), and [Privacy Policy](./docs/privacy-policy.md).

Lucy is open‑source under Apache 2.0; outputs are governed by `OUTPUTS-LICENSE.md`.

### Our north star

Build the first truly private, transparent, self‑improving AI that helps people suffer less and flourish more — and prove that autonomy, safety, and compassion can scale together.

We will not solve everything. But together, we can bend the trajectory of AI toward care.
