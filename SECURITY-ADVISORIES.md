# Security Advisories

Critical and high-severity issues will be assigned CVEs (when applicable) and
published as GitHub Security Advisories with mitigation steps and fixed versions.
Advisories are linked from release notes and SECURITY.md.

Response targets (non-binding):

- Acknowledge report: within 3 business days
- Initial assessment: within 7 business days
- Patch or mitigation available: within 90 days (or sooner for critical)

Coordinated disclosure timelines may be adjusted by mutual agreement with reporters.
