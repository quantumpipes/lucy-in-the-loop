# Security Advisories

Critical and high-severity issues will be assigned CVEs (when applicable) and
published as GitHub Security Advisories with mitigation steps and fixed versions.
Advisories are linked from release notes and SECURITY.md.

Response targets (non-binding):

- Acknowledge report: within 3 business days
- Initial assessment: within 7 business days
- Patch or mitigation available: within 90 days (or sooner for critical)

Coordinated disclosure timelines may be adjusted by mutual agreement with reporters.

## Breach Notifications (HBNR, State Laws)

If an incident involves unauthorized acquisition of identifiable health data (as
that concept is defined under the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule), we will:

- Evaluate HBNR applicability and any overlapping state healthâ€‘privacy laws.
- Notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay, and notify the FTC and
  media as required by HBNR for incidents affecting 500+ individuals.
- Where state requirements are stricter (e.g., WA My Health My Data Act, CA CPRA/CMIA),
  follow the most protective timeline and content requirements.
