## Code of Conduct

Lucy in the Loop is committed to fostering an **inclusive, respectful, and ethical community** for all contributors and users. We expect everyone involved in the project to uphold the following Code of Conduct, which applies in all project spaces (GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums, etc.) and interactions:

### Our Pledge

In the interest of cultivating a welcoming environment, **we pledge to make participation in Lucy in the Loop a harassment-free experience for everyone**. We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and identities – including but not limited to age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, nationality, and experience level – and will not tolerate any form of exclusion. We are building a community grounded in respect, empathy, and integrity.

### Standards of Behavior

To help maintain a positive and productive community, we expect the following behavior:

* **Respectful and Inclusive Communication:** Use considerate language. Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. Avoid derogatory or discriminatory comments. Collaboration works best when everyone feels valued.
* **Constructive Feedback:** Critique ideas, not people. Offer helpful and actionable feedback rather than personal attacks. Stay focused on how to improve the project or resolve problems.
* **Transparency and Honesty:** Be open about your intentions, and do not misrepresent your capabilities or contributions. If you’re unsure about something, it’s okay to ask questions or seek help. Honesty builds trust in our community.
* **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Respect user privacy at all times. Do not share sensitive data or personal information from user interactions. Adhere strictly to privacy regulations (e.g., **HIPAA** for health data, **GDPR** for personal data protection) and ensure the AI’s outputs or logs do not violate confidentiality.
* **Professionalism:** Maintain professional conduct in all project spaces. This includes using appropriate language, being punctual in addressing assigned issues or reviews, and following through on commitments. Treat the project like a shared professional endeavor.

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable in the Lucy in the Loop community and **will not be tolerated**:

* **Harassment or Bullying:** This includes offensive or unwelcome comments related to personal characteristics, threats of violence or intimidation, and stalking or sustained disruption of someone’s participation.
* **Discrimination:** Any prejudicial treatment or disparaging remarks toward an individual or group based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or any protected characteristic is forbidden.
* **Offensive Imagery or Language:** Posting content (images, code, or text) that is sexually explicit, graphically violent, or derogatory is not allowed. This includes using profanity or slurs intended to insult or belittle.
* **Privacy Violations or Unethical Use of AI:** Sharing personal data of users without consent, or suggesting usage of Lucy (or any AI) in ways that violate privacy, ethics, or laws (for example, promoting self-harm or illegal activities) is strictly prohibited. Lucy’s aim is to help people, and any use of it to harm or deceive others undermines our values.
* **Illicit or Malicious Behavior:** Encouraging illegal activities, or using project channels to spread malware, spam, or other harmful content. This also includes intentionally sabotaging the codebase or documentation.

### Reporting Violations

If you observe or experience any violation of this Code of Conduct, **please report it to the project maintainers immediately**. You can file a confidential report by opening an issue on our GitHub **Issue Tracker** (and marking it confidential/private if possible) or by emailing the maintainers (contact information is in the repository). When reporting, please include any relevant details or screenshots. **All reports will be kept confidential.** We are committed to protecting the privacy and safety of reporters.

Project maintainers will review all complaints **promptly and impartially**. They are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Enforcement

Maintainers are responsible for ensuring respectful behavior and may take any action they deem appropriate to uphold the code of conduct. **Consequences for confirmed violations may include**:

* A private or public warning and request for apology or corrective action.
* Temporary suspension from community spaces or project involvement (e.g., being unassigned from issues, or muted on discussion boards).
* Removal or banning from the project’s repository and community (temporary or permanent), particularly for repeated or severe offenses.
* In extreme cases (such as threats of violence, doxxing, or criminal activity), reporting the incident to appropriate authorities.

All enforcement decisions will be documented. Our goal is to be fair and consistent, prioritizing the safety and well-being of the community.

By contributing to or engaging with **Lucy in the Loop**, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. Let’s all work together to **foster a community built on mutual respect, collaboration, and trust**, so that Lucy in the Loop can grow in a healthy, inclusive environment.
