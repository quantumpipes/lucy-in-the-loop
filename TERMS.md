# Repository Terms of Use & Acceptable Use Policy

These Terms govern your use of the Lucy in the Loop source repository. The source
code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (“Apache 2.0”). Nothing in
these Terms limits the rights granted to you by Apache 2.0.

By cloning, building, or using the source, you agree:

1) No Professional Advice. Lucy in the Loop is an AI software project. It does not
provide medical, psychological, legal, or other professional advice. Do not rely
on it as a substitute for qualified human care. See MEDICAL-DISCLAIMER.md.

2) Acceptable Use. You will not use the project or derivative builds (the current repository contains documentation and policies; when binaries or application code are released, these terms will apply to those builds):
   • in safety-critical or high-risk environments (e.g., life support, emergency
     response, aviation, nuclear, or similar), or where failure could lead to death,
     personal injury, or severe environmental or property damage;
   • to provide regulated clinical diagnosis or treatment; or
   • in violation of law, or to infringe, defame, harass, or otherwise harm others.

3) Autonomy & Self-Modification. Builds may modify themselves (e.g., autonomous
agent updates). YOU are responsible for reviewing and controlling any changes
before deployment in your environment.

4) Third-Party Code, Models, and Plugins. You are responsible for verifying all
third‑party dependencies, models, or plugins and their licenses. Maintainers do
not audit third‑party contributions. See PLUGIN-TERMS.md.

4a) Outputs License. You own your prompts and, to the extent permitted by law,
your outputs. Outputs are informational and may be wrong or unsafe if misused.
See OUTPUTS-LICENSE.md for additional terms governing model outputs.

5) No Warranties; Assumption of Risk. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
the repository, code, models, documentation, and outputs are provided “AS IS”
and “WITH ALL FAULTS,” without warranties of any kind (express, implied, or
statutory), including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, accuracy, non‑infringement, or that outputs are correct,
safe, or suitable. You understand and agree you use Lucy at your own risk.

6) Limitation of Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Quantum Pipes, LLC,
contributors, and maintainers will not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, or increased damages, or for lost
profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or
relating to your use of the repository or any derivatives, even if advised of the
possibility of such damages. Where a limitation of liability is not enforceable,
the total aggregate liability for direct damages shall not exceed the greater of
USD $100 or the amounts you paid (if any) for the software in the twelve (12)
months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

7) Indemnity. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Quantum Pipes, LLC,
contributors, and maintainers from and against claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising
from or related to your use, deployment, or distribution of the project, your
derivatives, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

8) Export Controls and Sanctions. You will comply with applicable export and
sanctions laws. See EXPORT.md.

9) Trademarks. Use of the “Lucy in the Loop” and “Quantum Pipes” names and logos
is governed by TRADEMARKS.md and does not imply endorsement.

10) Changes. Terms may be updated in the repository. Continued use after changes
means acceptance. Version history is maintained in Git.

11) EU AI Act Notice. If you distribute, deploy, or make available Lucy in the
European Union, you agree to comply with applicable obligations under Regulation
(EU) 2024/1689 (the “AI Act”). If you act as a general‑purpose AI (GPAI) provider,
you will prepare and publish model documentation and risk measures consistent with
the applicable Code of Practice; if you act as a deployer, you will implement
appropriate transparency, logging, and risk controls for your use case. See
docs/transparent-autonomy-policy.md for transparency and logging practices.
