## Plugin Ecosystem Manifesto

Lucy in the Loop is not just an application; it’s a platform meant to grow and adapt. A key part of that adaptability is a robust plugin ecosystem. This manifesto explains our philosophy and plan for plugins – optional modules that extend Lucy’s functionality – and how we ensure they remain safe, privacy-preserving, and in line with the project’s values. We call it a “manifesto” because it’s a statement of principles for anyone developing or using plugins for Lucy.

### Why Plugins?

No single system can natively handle every possible feature or integrate with every tool that users might want. By supporting plugins, we allow the community to add new capabilities to Lucy without bloating the core or compromising security:

* Plugins enable **modularity**: Users can choose which extensions they need (e.g., a mood-tracking plugin, a fitness coach plugin, integration with task managers, etc.), keeping the base system lean.
* They foster **innovation**: Independent developers (or even Lucy’s AI Dev Agents) can create plugins experimenting with new ideas without altering core code, accelerating development.
* They allow **integration**: Lucy can connect with other local apps/devices. For example, a plugin could let Lucy read data from a wearable health tracker or interface with a local calendar app to help schedule wellness activities – all offline and under user control.

### Security & Privacy for Plugins

While we welcome extensibility, we prioritize security and privacy:

* **Sandboxed Execution:** All plugins run in a strict sandbox, isolated from the core system and OS. We use WebAssembly (via WasmEdge) as the runtime for plugins. This means a plugin is compiled to WASM bytecode and executed by Lucy’s plugin engine (Extism) with only the permissions explicitly granted. A plugin cannot access the file system, network, or any data unless Lucy provides specific APIs to it.
* **Permission Model:** Plugins declare what capabilities they need in a manifest (for instance: “needs read access to daily step count from fitness device plugin API”). When installing/enabling a plugin, the user is shown these requested permissions and must approve them. Lucy will expose only the minimal data or functions to the plugin. For example, if a plugin is for journaling, it might need to save text entries – we might grant it a key-value store API from the core (where core ensures it’s stored encrypted), but the plugin never sees other data.
* **No Internet for Plugins:** By default, plugins are not allowed to make arbitrary internet requests (consistent with offline ethos). If a plugin truly needs to fetch something (say a weather plugin wanting weather data for context), it must go through Lucy’s network module which can be tightly controlled or use pre-approved APIs. We prefer plugins to use local resources. The default stance: **internet access is disabled** for plugins to prevent any data leakage or external dependency.
* **Isolation and Resource Limits:** Each plugin has resource limits (memory, execution time quotas) to prevent abuse or accidental heavy use that could slow Lucy. If a plugin misbehaves (e.g., uses too much CPU or tries a forbidden action), Lucy will terminate it and log an alert. This ensures a faulty or malicious plugin can’t hang or crash the whole system.
* **Code Signing & Review:** We will have a plugin registry (like a small directory) for community plugins. Developers should sign their plugins, and we will show that info to users (so you know it hasn’t been tampered with since publishing). Ideally, the community or maintainers will review popular plugins’ source code for security/privacy before listing them. We encourage open-source plugins so they can be audited. Closed-source plugins can be loaded too (since compiled WASM), but we will flag them as such so user knows trust is solely in the publisher in that case.
* **Compatibility and Safety Checks:** Lucy’s core might scan a plugin’s bytecode for known dangerous patterns (like importing disallowed syscalls). The Extism framework itself helps enforce boundaries. The Compliance Agent can also audit plugin behavior over time – if a plugin unexpectedly tries to access something beyond its scope (shouldn’t be possible, but if somehow it attempted), it would be blocked and user notified.

### Principles for Plugin Developers

We outline principles in this manifesto that plugin authors should follow:

* **Privacy-First Functionality:** Don’t design plugins that send user data out. Respect the local-first model – if your plugin, say, analyzes something, do it on device. If it must use an external service (like maybe a therapy chatbot plugin using an external model – though arguably redundant), you must be transparent and get user consent for every transmission. Such plugins likely won’t be featured in our official registry unless there’s a compelling reason and it’s sandboxed properly through the core (e.g., retrieving some generic info like weather or news in a privacy-respecting way).
* **Open Source & Collaboration:** We encourage making plugin source code open and sharing it for community improvement. This aligns with Lucy’s open ethos. It also helps your plugin gain trust.
* **Interoperability:** Use the provided plugin API surfaces rather than hacks. If you need a new API to do something (like access the user’s schedule or connect with another plugin), request it via the community – perhaps the core can expose a safe method for that. Don’t try to circumvent restrictions (like no direct file access means exactly that – don’t try to encode data in covert channels).
* **Efficiency:** Write plugins in a lightweight manner. Many plugins will be event-driven (e.g., on certain user command or daily trigger). They shouldn’t hog CPU in loops. If possible, do non-critical computations in small chunks and yield (WASM can yield via host calls if needed, or we implement an async plugin interface).
* **Modularity:** If your plugin could be split or reused, consider making it modular. For example, if multiple future plugins might need sentiment analysis, perhaps one plugin provides a sentiment analysis service (or the core does already). Avoid duplicating heavy logic – leverage core agents when appropriate. The plugin API allows calling certain core functions (like maybe the core could expose “get current mood summary” or “classify text sentiment” so plugins don’t need their own ML for that).
* **Security Mindset:** Assume your plugin will be scrutinized. Plan for worst-case: if an attacker tried to use your plugin to do X, can they? Maybe put in sanity checks or at least outline in docs how it’s safe. Also handle errors gracefully (so if plugin fails, it doesn’t break user experience – Lucy will catch exceptions, but plugin should try to clean up states on error if needed).

### Plugin API and Capabilities

Lucy exposes a **Plugin SDK** (likely via the Extism interface and some predefined host functions):
Examples of capabilities we intend to provide plugins:

* **Data Storage API:** a simple key-value store or file-like API for plugin to keep its own data (which core will store securely). E.g., a mood tracker plugin can store daily mood ratings here.
* **Core Service API:** call certain core agents or services. For instance, a plugin can ask the Conversation Agent to say something to the user (so if plugin wants to output a suggestion or notification, it can route that through Lucy’s normal conversation pipeline). Or a plugin can subscribe to events like “user opened app” or “user completed a session” to act on.
* **Sensor/Device API:** if user grants, plugins can access local sensors or device data through core. For example, a step-count plugin could get steps from a local health service on the OS (if permission given) by having core query it and return to plugin. We don’t let plugin directly call OS; core will act as broker.
* **UI Hooks:** A plugin might add an item to the UI (like a tab or a panel). We will define ways for plugins to extend the UI in a controlled manner. For instance, a plugin could provide a small React component or declare “I need a page to display charts”, and our UI will embed it (probably plugin provides logic in WASM for computing data and a description of UI, and core UI renders it). This is complex, so initially plugin UI might be simple: like plugin can output markdown or JSON for core to render. But we plan to allow richer UI as needed.
* **Scheduling API:** Plugins can schedule tasks or set reminders via core. E.g., a plugin could say “please call me daily at 9am” for a daily check-in event. Core’s scheduler will then invoke the plugin’s function on time.
* **Communication with other Plugins:** Possibly via core as intermediary. Maybe we allow events to be published that multiple plugins listen to (like a message bus). Example: a “Sleep Tracker” plugin and “Exercise Tracker” plugin might both publish daily stats events, and a “Health Summary” plugin might gather them. The core can manage such event routing so that one plugin doesn’t directly call into another (which would break isolation).

We document all these in a Plugin Developer Guide (which this manifesto summarises philosophically).

### Community Governance of Plugins

To maintain quality and safety:

* We will have a **Plugin Review Board** (initially maintainers, later possibly elected community members including developers and maybe a security expert). They oversee the plugin repository: approving new plugins to the official list, auditing ones that become popular, and de-listing any that violate rules or become unmaintained/insecure.
* Users can install any plugin by providing the Wasm or manifest file, but the UI will warn if it’s not from the trusted repository or signed by a known developer.
* If a plugin is found to be harmful or not up to standard, we’ll issue advisories and possibly push an update to core to blacklist it (the Governance Charter’s safety oversight extends here: we won’t allow an unsafe plugin to undermine the whole system).
* However, we respect user freedom: power users can still side-load if they accept the risk. But our defaults will guide less technical users to safe choices.

### Examples of Potential Plugins

To illustrate the possibilities (and how they fit our principles):

* **Physical Activity Coach:** Integrates with a local fitness wearable’s data (steps, heart rate). It would use a core API to fetch daily step count (with user permission). It might then have Lucy suggest walking when step count is low. Security: it only sees step count and maybe heart rate; doesn’t access location or identity. Data stays local.
* **Pomodoro Focus Timer:** Helps user manage focus sessions for productivity (peak performance angle). It might add a UI element (a timer) and issue gentle notifications via Lucy’s conversation agent like "Your focus session is over, take a 5 min break." Minimal permissions, mostly uses UI and scheduler.
* **Integration with note-taking apps:** Suppose a user wants Lucy to pull tasks from their local ToDo app (like an open-source task manager). A plugin could read tasks from that app’s local database (with permission) and allow Lucy to reference them in conversations (like “I see you planned to call your friend – did you get a chance?”). This requires careful permissions: reading that app’s data, which is personal, but it stays local and Lucy is already a trusted context.
* **Additional Therapy Modalities:** e.g., a plugin for specialized techniques like EMDR support (just hypothetical – EMDR is usually with a practitioner, but maybe aspects can be guided). This plugin could handle certain exercises with visuals or sounds. It might need to play audio/visual patterns – we’d allow that through a media API. All content delivered by it should be pre-packaged (or generated offline) and vetted for safety.

Each plugin should align with Lucy’s mission: improving mental health and performance ethically. We would likely not endorse plugins that are unrelated or against that mission on our official list (like a plugin purely for entertainment or something not in scope, though users could still create them; but for example, a plugin that tries to do stock trading advice by connecting to internet – not our focus and would have safety concerns, so not in official repo).

### Transparent Autonomy and Plugins

One interesting aspect: Lucy’s own AI agents might eventually create or modify plugins to extend themselves. That is fine – they would use the same plugin interface (AI Coder could spin off a plugin if it thinks a feature should be modular). But all the above rules still apply, and the human oversight in governance would review such AI-created plugins especially carefully before broad enabling.

We include in the manifesto the stance that **autonomy does not trump user control**. So any plugin (no matter who made it) is subject to user approval. Lucy will explain what a plugin will do and only proceed if user is comfortable.

### Conclusion and Vision for Plugin Ecosystem

We envision a thriving ecosystem where community contributions can easily augment Lucy:

* Clinicians who code can add new therapeutic exercises as plugins.
* Users can share creative enhancements (like mood journaling, gratitude exercises, etc.).
* Small teams or companies could create value-add plugins (even commercial ones if they want, though they’d need a mechanism for licensing – possibly outside of our scope, but as long as they follow sandbox rules, it’s allowed).
* The plugin ecosystem will help Lucy adapt to specialized niches without making the core system complex for everyone.

This manifesto sets the tone: we welcome extensions but not at the expense of our core values of privacy, security, and ethical use. Each plugin should make Lucy better while **keeping the loop closed** (local) unless explicitly opened with consent.

By adhering to these principles, the plugin ecosystem will flourish with user trust. We will continuously work with plugin developers to improve the API, adding more capabilities in a safe manner so they can innovate. This also ties into Lucy’s autonomous evolution – as new needs arise, maybe a plugin is a quick way to prototype a solution which can then either remain a plugin or, if universally useful, be absorbed into core (with user consent and possibly toggles).

In summary, the Plugin Ecosystem Manifesto is our commitment to an open, collaborative, and secure extension model for Lucy in the Loop – enabling endless personalization and improvement, while rigorously safeguarding what matters most: the user’s well-being, privacy, and trust.
