## Security & Data Protection Policy

Lucy in the Loop is engineered with a security-first mindset to protect user data and ensure system integrity at all times. This Security & Data Protection Policy outlines the measures and protocols in place to safeguard the software and the information it handles. We recognize that trust is paramount for a mental health application, and we treat security and privacy as inseparable goals.

### Secure by Design Architecture

From the ground up, Lucy’s architecture incorporates security principles (the following describe the intended design; implementation is planned and will be publicly tracked):

* **Isolated Execution (Sandboxing):** Each agent (or group of agents) runs in a sandboxed environment with minimal privileges. For example, the core AI agents run with only access to needed resources (they can read/write to the encrypted local store via the Privacy Agent, but cannot, say, access arbitrary system files). The plugin system uses WebAssembly sandboxes, meaning any third-party plugin cannot escape its sandbox to harm the system or steal data. Sandboxing prevents a compromise in one component from cascading to others.
* **Least Privilege:** Agents operate under the principle of least privilege. The Compliance/Privacy framework ensures agents request permission for any sensitive action. If the AI Coder agent wants to install a new library, it must go through a security check. If a plugin wants to access a sensor (like microphone for a voice feature), the user must grant that explicit permission, and even then, that plugin can’t access anything else.
* **Zero Trust Data Access:** Internally, we assume no agent is inherently trusted with data – every data access is verified. The Access Controller (Privacy Agent) treats interactions as if they were external requests; for instance, when the Conversation Agent wants to retrieve past conversation context, it calls a controlled interface rather than directly reading the file, so Privacy Agent can filter/redact if necessary. This internal zero-trust approach means even if an agent were subverted, it has hurdles to jump to get unauthorized data.
* **End-to-End Encryption (Local):** All user data stored is encrypted at rest with strong algorithms (AES-256 or ChaCha20 as appropriate). Additionally, any data in transit *internally* that might be sensitive (like between agents or in memory) is considered ephemeral – but if we ever write to disk or a swap file, that data is encrypted or sanitized by design. If the user does opt to backup data or transmit something, that is encrypted in transit (e.g., if sending an encrypted therapy summary to their clinician, we encourage using secure channels). Because by default nothing leaves the device, encryption mainly matters on the device: e.g., the database file storing conversation logs is encrypted, with keys managed by Lucy (and possibly tied to user credentials or OS keystore for extra safety).
* **Immutable Audit Logs:** Security-relevant events are recorded in an append-only log that is cryptographically signed. This means if someone did try to tamper with Lucy’s operations, the logs would show it (or the signature verification would fail, indicating tampering). Events logged include agent update actions, rule/policy changes, kill switch activations, login attempts to any admin interface, etc. These logs are stored in a secure part of the local store and can be inspected by the user or maintainers (if user shares them for troubleshooting). They provide accountability and traceability.

### Data Protection Measures

* **Data Encryption & Key Management:** As mentioned, all data at rest is encrypted. Keys are generated per device and do not leave the device. The Encryption Manager (part of Privacy Agent) rotates encryption keys periodically – for example, it might use different keys for different data types and rotate them every X days, re-encrypting data under new keys (the old keys are securely wiped) to limit exposure window if a key somehow was compromised. The master keys can be tied to user secrets (like a passphrase) if the user opts for an extra layer (this would mean they need to enter a password to unlock Lucy’s data on each start, which some high-security users might want; otherwise it relies on OS secure storage).
* **Access Control & Authentication:** Access to Lucy’s interfaces (like the local web UI or CLI) can be gated by authentication. On personal devices, this might be optional, but for multi-user systems, you can enable a login (e.g., a PIN or device auth). The Access Controller enforces that only authenticated users can see sensitive dashboards (like the Privacy dashboard with raw data). If Lucy is running as a service (like on a home server), you can set up credentials to control who can connect to it. Internally, agent-to-agent communication uses tokens to verify the sender is an allowed component.
* **No Cloud Storage by Default:** We reiterate – by default **no user data is uploaded** to any server. This significantly reduces many typical attack surfaces (no centralized database to breach, no API traffic with personal data). The primary data repository is the user’s device which they physically control. That said, the device could be lost or stolen, so the encryption at rest is critical in those scenarios. If the user uses a device-level encryption (like Full Disk Encryption on their OS), that adds another layer too (defense in depth).
* **Backups:** We encourage users to backup their data (mental health progress, journal, etc.) but we provide options to do so securely. For instance, an “Export Data” function can produce an encrypted archive of their conversation history and settings, which they can store somewhere safe. This way, even if they choose to use cloud storage for backup, the data remains encrypted client-side (like a secure vault). Lucy itself might offer to schedule encrypted backups to a user-chosen location. The encryption passphrase for backups would be user-defined (so not tied to the device, in case the device is lost).
* **Data Minimization & Retention:** We store the least amount of data necessary for functionality. For example, if aggregate statistics can be computed and raw data not needed, raw data is purged after use. The system by default deletes old conversation data after 90 days (configurable), as noted in the Privacy Policy. Users can adjust retention or disable it if they want long-term memory, but we default to cleaning up to limit potential exposure window. Also, certain sensitive data might have even shorter lifespan (e.g., if a user temporarily connects Lucy to a wearable to get heart rate during a breathing exercise, Lucy might process it but not store that heart rate data beyond the session unless explicitly told to).
* **Differential Privacy for Analytics:** In the event the user opts into sharing some usage analytics, we apply differential privacy algorithms. This means adding controlled noise to the data so that individual usage patterns cannot be reconstructed, yet aggregate trends can be learned. This protects individuals even when data is aggregated. For example, if collecting "percentage of sessions where user reported feeling better," a little noise would be added from each user’s contribution such that no single user’s exact pattern is revealed.
* **Right to Erasure:** If the user wishes to wipe their data, they can do so easily (via a “Delete All Data” function). Lucy will securely delete all personal data – filling with zeros or using OS secure delete where possible. Even logs are removed (except maybe audit logs if the user chooses to keep those separate, but those can have personal info redacted or be deleted as well). Essentially, the user can return Lucy to factory state. We ensure no hidden copies remain (the Deletion Scheduler and Compliance Agent double-check that data is gone).
* **Data Breach Preparedness:** Although a breach is unlikely given no server, we consider device compromise scenarios. If Lucy detects any sign of malware on the device (maybe via an optional integration or anomaly via Security Agent), it can alert the user that the environment may be unsafe for sensitive conversation (and perhaps suspend operations). Also, if a vulnerability in Lucy is discovered that could potentially lead to data leakage, we will treat it like an emergency: patch it (Security Agent likely already did) and notify users via the community channels to update (if not auto-updated). Transparency is key – if any security incident happened, we would disclose it and guide users on protective measures (though again, with local-first design, one user’s incident doesn’t affect others).

### Network Security (when applicable)

While Lucy is offline by default, it does open a local web interface. We secure that interface:

* **Localhost-Only:** The web UI by default binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1), not accessible remotely. If users want to access it from another device, they must explicitly allow it and ideally use SSH tunneling or a VPN for security. We do not by default allow remote connections without encryption.
* **HTTPS for UI:** Even on localhost, we could allow an HTTPS connection with a self-signed cert to prevent any possible man-in-the-middle (though the threat on localhost is low; mainly relevant if user inadvertently accesses the UI in a dangerous context). For remote access (if enabled), we strongly encourage enabling HTTPS (and provide guidance to set up a certificate or use a provided one). The UI does not serve any data to the internet.
* **No Open Ports by Default:** Lucy doesn’t require any open incoming network ports beyond the UI port, which is loopback. It doesn’t run a general HTTP server to the world. And it makes no outbound requests containing user data. If it does reach out (for optional updates or research fetch), those connections are made secure (TLS encryption) and through known endpoints. The Security Agent monitors any unusual network activity (like if malware tried to piggyback on Lucy or if a plugin tried to call home unauthorized, it would block it).
* **Firewall Suggestions:** We will document that users can (and maybe should) run Lucy behind a personal firewall that only allows intended connections. Since Lucy usually doesn’t need internet, one could block it entirely from internet access via firewall except when updating. Even when allowed, restricting it to known domains (like GitHub for updates, or known research API endpoints) adds a layer. While not built-in, we recommend power users consider this. Lucy’s design (all core functions offline) supports that easily.

### Proactive Security Features

* **24/7 Threat Monitoring:** Lucy’s Security Agent effectively does this continuously on the device. Because it’s AI-driven, it can notice patterns that traditional antivirus might miss (like an unusual sequence of system calls or an agent acting out of character).
* **Auto-Patching:** We’ve noted, but to stress: as soon as a vulnerability is known, Lucy can generate and apply a patch often faster than a vendor can formally release one. For example, if a library Lucy uses has a buffer overflow, the Security Agent identifies it (maybe from CVE feeds or its own analysis) and triggers AI Coder to update that library or apply a code fix. That patch is tested and then applied, possibly within minutes or hours of the vuln’s disclosure. This drastically lowers window of exposure. Patches are cryptographically verified (to prevent any supply chain attack injecting malicious update).
* **Adaptive Defense:** The system learns from any attempted attack. If, say, someone tried to get Lucy to reveal private data through a clever prompt injection, Llama-Guard filter would catch it and the attempt is logged. The Compliance Agent might then add that prompt pattern to a block list or adjust the AI’s prompt to resist such attempts. Over time, Lucy’s defenses strengthen as it encounters new threats.
* **Consensus & Multi-Sig for Critical Actions:** For actions like releasing an update or deleting large data, multiple agents (or approvals) are required. E.g., AI Coder proposes an update, but Security Agent and Compliance Agent must “co-sign” that it’s safe. This is akin to multi-signature in security – no single component can wreak havoc without others agreeing. If there’s any disagreement (like Compliance says “this update might violate privacy”), the action is halted and escalated to human oversight.
* **Integrity Verification:** Critical files (executables, model weights, etc.) have integrity hashes. On startup and periodically, Lucy verifies its own code hasn’t been tampered with (kind of like Tripwire for itself). If something doesn’t match (like an important file’s hash changed unexpectedly), it alerts the user and possibly replaces the file with a known-good version (from cache or re-download) and investigates cause. This stops unauthorized modifications from persisting.
* **Secure Development Pipeline:** Although internal, we treat the autonomous development pipeline with same security as a traditional pipeline: any code changes by AI Coder must pass tests (including security tests) and are reviewed by at least one other agent, which could be a specialized “Code Audit Agent” focusing on security implications. The repository of code can use git signed commits (the AI can use a key to sign its commits which are verified). If humans contribute, they sign theirs. This chain of trust ensures the codebase integrity.
* **SOC2 and Beyond:** If one were to measure Lucy against common security frameworks (like SOC 2 criteria or ISO 27001), many controls are inherently satisfied: encryption, access control, change management, etc., albeit all automated. We aim for 100% continuous compliance. The Compliance Agent can even produce a report mapping what Lucy does to those control checklists.

### User Responsibilities and Best Practices

We empower users with secure defaults, but also provide guidance for them to maintain security:

* We advise users to keep their device OS secure and updated (Lucy can’t prevent OS-level malware if present). Lucy might remind users of this in a friendly way.
* Users should use a strong system password and enable disk encryption on their device – Lucy will integrate well with those (like storing its key in OS secure enclave if available).
* We provide an optional “Parental/Supervisor Lock” mode if a clinician or parent is overseeing usage – where certain settings can’t be changed without a password (for cases where a user might be a minor or something).
* Regular backups of the encrypted data, as mentioned, to not lose progress but keep backups safe.
* If remote access is enabled (like wanting to use Lucy from phone to connect to home PC running it), we guide them through setting up SSH tunneling or secure VPN – we don’t leave them to do something insecure like open a port directly to internet.

### Handling of Third-Party Components

Lucy uses open-source libraries for some functions. Our policy with those:

* We pin specific versions and verify their integrity (hash check at install).
* The Security Agent monitors those components for any security advisories.
* If a component’s maintainers vanish or it gets outdated, AI Coder can even “internalize” it (pull code in and maintain it under Lucy’s umbrella) to not depend on an insecure source.
* All third-party code is scanned by our own static analysis and testing for backdoors or unwanted behavior.
* Only well-vetted sources are allowed (for example, AI Coder will only fetch from trusted package registries, and even then, we might maintain an allowlist of libraries).

### Privacy and Security Compliance

We ensure our policies align with regulations:

* Under GDPR and similar, data breaches (if they ever occurred) would require notification. With local-only, the concept is different (a breach would be more like malware on device). But our commitment is to treat any serious security issue with full transparency to users and, if applicable, any legal compliance.
* We maintain a Privacy Impact Assessment and Threat Model document internally (and share a sanitized version publicly) where we enumerate potential risks and how we mitigate them. This is both good practice and often expected in compliance regimes.
* If Lucy is used in a clinical setting, we have documentation for IT admins on how to configure it to meet their institution’s security policies (like disabling any optional comms completely, enforcing certain log retention, etc.). Lucy can operate in a locked-down mode (no network code present at all) if needed – good for high-security environments.

### Failsafe Mechanisms

Finally, connecting to Failsafe Protocols: The kill switch is the ultimate security tool if something seems wrong. At any sign of compromise, a user or maintainer can hit emergency-stop to instantly halt all AI processes. Additionally, the system has an automated failsafe: if the Governance Agent or Security Agent ever detect a runaway condition or severe anomaly, they can trigger an automatic shutdown or reboot of Lucy’s AI components. This stops everything in a safe state (data remains encrypted) until a human can inspect. It’s a last resort, but it’s there to prevent any potential harm from a malfunction or breach escalating.

In summary, our security and data protection approach is **multi-layered**: prevent issues with strong design, monitor continuously for any issues, respond swiftly and automatically if possible, and always keep the user in control and informed. We aim for Lucy in the Loop to not only be *as secure as* conventional mental health apps, but in many ways *more secure*, thanks to local control and intelligent automation of defense. Our goal is a track record of zero incidents, but we are prepared for anything.
