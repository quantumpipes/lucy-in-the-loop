# Trademark Policy

"Lucy in the Loop" and the Lucy logo are trademarks of Quantum Pipes, LLC.
Use of the trademarks must not suggest sponsorship or endorsement by Quantum
Pipes unless you have a separate written permission.

Permitted (without written permission):
• Descriptive use to refer to the project (e.g., “Built with Lucy in the Loop”).
• Forks/distributions that accurately state “Unofficial” and remove/replace logos.

Not permitted without written permission:
• Using the name or logo as part of your product or company name.
• Using confusingly similar marks or logos.
• Implying affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement, including claiming or
  implying that your build is clinically approved, certified, or endorsed for
  medical use.

You may use the trademarks in accordance with nominative fair use and applicable
law. For questions: trademarks@lucyintheloop.org.

Community builds and endorsement: Community forks or distributions must clearly
label themselves as “Unofficial” or “Community Build.” Use of the Lucy mark may
not imply clinical validation or safety certification. We reserve the right to
revoke trademark usage that misleads users about safety, clinical claims, or
endorsement.
